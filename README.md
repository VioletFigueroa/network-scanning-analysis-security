# Network Administration & Digital Forensics

## Overview
Network administration and digital forensics project featuring network scanning, traffic analysis, and executive reporting. This project demonstrates network reconnaissance techniques, vulnerability identification, and comprehensive security documentation for stakeholders.

## Objectives
- Conduct network reconnaissance and mapping
- Identify systems and services on network
- Analyze network traffic for security insights
- Document network architecture and configurations
- Provide executive-level security reporting

## Methodology
- Network scanning using advanced reconnaissance tools
- Network traffic capture and analysis
- Service enumeration and vulnerability identification
- Network diagram creation and documentation
- Executive summary development
- Risk assessment and recommendations

## Key Findings
- Complete network topology and asset inventory
- Identified services and potential vulnerabilities
- Network traffic patterns and baselines
- Security control assessment
- Risk prioritization and remediation roadmap

## Technologies Used
